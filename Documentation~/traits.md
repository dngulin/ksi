# Trait System

Ñ¯-Framework defines a set of special attributes (traits) that enable extra diagnostics
and code generation for marked structures:

- Structures that should not be implicitly copied should be marked with the `[ExplicitCopy]` attribute
- Structures that own dynamically allocated data should be marked with the `[DynSized]` attribute
that enables referencing safety checks
- For some `[DynSized]` structures the allocator policy attribute is also required:
  - The `[Dealloc]` attribute generates deallocation API and enables extra diagnostics
  - The `[TempAlloc]` attribute makes deallocation not required in exchange to be stored only on stack

## ExplicitCopyAttribute

The `[ExplicitCopy]` attribute enforces move semantics for a marked struct preventing any implicit copying.
It should be used for structures that have any `[ExplicitCopy]` fields like `RefList<T>`.

For moving ownership use the `Move` extension method:
```
var listA = RefList.Empty<int>();
listA.RefAdd() = 42;
var listB = listA.Move(); // `listA` copied to `listB` and then zeroed
```

The trait also enables code generation that produces explicit copy extensions.

### Generated ExplicitCopy API

Usage of the `[ExplicitCopy]` attribute triggers code generation of `CopyTo` and `CopyFrom` methods
for the marked type and possible containers:

- `TStruct CopyTo(this in TStruct self, ref TStruct other)`
- `TStruct CopyForm(this ref TStruct self, in TStruct other)`
- `void CopyTo(this in TRefList<TStruct> self, ref TRefList<TStruct> other)`
- `void CopyFrom(this ref TRefList<TStruct> self, in TRefList<TStruct> other)`

Where `TStruct` is the structure name and `TRefList` is a [compatible collection](collections.md) name.

> [!WARNING]
> Explicit copy extension methods require access to the structure fields and their types:
> - the structure cannot have private fields
> - the structure cannot be generic

## DynSizedAttribute

The `[DynSized]` attribute indicates that the structure owns dynamically allocated data.
It should be used for structures that have any `[DynSized]` fields like `RefList<T>`.
And it also requires `[ExplicitCopy]` attribute.

The main purpose of the attribute is to indicate types affected by compile time referencing safety analysis.
For details see the [Referencing Rules](borrow-checker-at-home.md) section.

### DynSized Diagnostics

## DeallocAttribute

The `[Dealloc]` attribute indicates a type that should be deallocated with the `Dealloc` extension method.
It requires `[ExplicitCopy]` attribute and should be used for structures that have
any `[Dealloc]` fields like `RefList<T>`.

### Generated Dealloc API

Usage of the `[Dealloc]` attribute triggers code generation of `Dealloc` and `Deallocated` methods
for the marked type:

- `void Dealloc(this ref TStruct self)` - deallocates all data owned by the struct
- `ref TStruct Deallocated(this ref TStruct self)` - deallocate the struct and returns it as
an _assignable_ reference (see the `DEALLOC04` diagnostic message)

It also generates specialized API calls for [compatible collections](collections.md):
- `void Dealloc(this in TRefList<TStruct> self)` - specialized version that deallocate collection items
- `ref TRefList Deallocated(this ref TRefList<TStruct> self)` - wrapper around the specialized `Dealloc` extension
- `void RemoveAt(this ref TRefList<TStruct> self, int index)` - specialized version that deallocate collection items
- `void Clear(this ref TRefList<TStruct> self)` - specialized version that deallocate collection items

> [!NOTE]
> The `Dealloc` extension method is also generated for collections
> that don't require deallocation like `TempRefList<T>`.
> In that case collection items are deallocated, but the collection itself is not cleared

### NonAllocatedResultAttribute

If you are sure that your method returns a deallocated instance, you can use the `[NonAllocatedResult]` attribute
to suppress the `DEALLOC04` diagnostic.

> [!WARNING]
> There is no diagnostic analyzer to verify if the instance is actually deallocated.
> Incorrect usage of the attribute can cause memory leaks due to missing deallocation.
